# SlackBots
Nice.

Each bot is used for a one off purpose, anything more would be a bit much

No instructions provided to save your workspace members from such horrible fates

_Use at your own whim_

# List of bots
* SlackmojiBot - Spams out slackmojis, making reading messages on mobile nearly impossible
* Shrimpy (external repo) - Similar to SlackmojiBot but targets a single user's messages with the shrimp reaction

# Planned bots
* McRib Tracking bot (it's coming back baby)
* SANS ISC Reporting bot (For those infosec guys)
* Slack Archive & view bot (these actually exist as seperate things but I might tape them together / recreate one)
* A bot to make 3D printers talk to slack? probably hooking into octoprint somehow?
* A bot to drive basic features of Kali
* A bot to manage basic Uni Club stuff
* something else
